## Little remarks about the technical test

This repository has been generated by using the official Api Platform template (https://github.com/api-platform/api-platform/generate) for simplicity sake thus it contains multiple services and components totally unnecessary considering the scope of the test
(For example the db/client/admin/mercure services, Doctrine as well is not necessary here)

## Install
`docker-compose pull`
`docker-compose up -d`
You're good to go! You should be able to request the api at https://localhost:8443/movies/{id} 
(For example https://localhost:8443/movies/tt0758758)

**You must disable SSL certificate verification for the api to work properly as it uses as Self signed SSL Certificate**
